                <div class="section-text half">
                    <p>Having grown up in Rome, Leona immigrated to the United States in 2010. Although fluent in four languages,
                        Italian is her greatest love. She has experience working as a translator, and has been teaching Italian
                        to eager students for more than seven years now. Leona’s students love their lessons, look forward
                        to every session, and, most importantly,
                        <span class="text-accent">reach their goals</span>—whether they be communicating with family, preparing for travel, launching
                        an international business, working towards Italian citizenship, or expressing love (even wedding
                        vows!) with the most passionate words.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        <span class="text-accent">Read the testimonials</span> from her students to see how they achieved their goals as they developed
                        a lasting friendship and gained a passion for the Italian language.

                    <h5>Unique Lesson Style</h4>
                        <p>The key is flexibility, energy, and a comfortable environment. Leona meets her students in convenient
                            locations that help them relax—coffee shops, bookstores, happy hours, and even Skype when a face-to-face
                            is difficult. Singles, couples, and group rates are available, weekday evenings and Saturday
                            mornings. Lessons are highly conversational with an emphasis on proper grammar and recitation
                            until pronunciation and inflection are correct. Students read topical articles, talk about their
                            days and families, and hear all about Italian places and customs with tips for getting around
                            town…in a combination of Italian and English that changes as students grow more confident.</p>
